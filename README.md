# go-grocery-store

First => (I declare the structs and the global variables)

  .then() => (
    create the function with the logic to describe the each "queue" with a cashier and named as createQtOfRegisters
  )

  .then() => (
    create a function to retrieve and execute the selected archieve and until now named as cashier
  ).catch(func name) => (
    I may change the name of this function in future to better represent it
  )

  .then() => (
    main function to receive the name of archieve and execute the program's logic
  ).catch(import package) => (
    for some reason I'm having problems with import my own functions from another files, and for resolve quickly I bundle all together in main.go
  )
